## Inspiration

  People in nowadays become a mental disorder and number of them is more in-
crease. The causes of this disorder are often unclear because it is usually defined by
a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. Researchers have
identifiedavarietyofbiological, psychological, andenvironmentalfactorsthatcancon-
tribute to the development or progression of mental disorders. Focus on the life experi-
ence and environmental factors as a main, Some events have chance to evoke feelings
of loss or damage are most likely to cause a mental disorder to develop in an individual.
For example, live with poor parent in long term, people relationship etc.

  Machine learning is technique to insight the among of data in the real world,
learn it, return the information, meaning or pattern that hide inside the data as model,
and use this model solves the problem related with the data. To learn the data, Machine
learning receives input data that can be category data or numerical data. For example
data from patients. In this report, I use C5.0 algorithm from decision tree, one technique
from machine learning to decide the patient need to be treated.
